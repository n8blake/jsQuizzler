# jsQuizzler
A simple JavaScript quiz app. The questions are pulled from a popular Javascript Question repo provided by Lydia Hallie, and then converted into an API by Tom Byrer. jsQuizzler uses this data to generate a timed Javascript Quiz web app. The game runs as long as the user keeps getting questions corretly. If the user answers a question incorrectly, the time goes down. If the user answers correctly the time is added. The questions automatically advance once answered and the game is done when the time reaches zero.
